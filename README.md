## Project Description

This project was developed in response to a friend's request and offers the following features:

- **Sentence Collection**: Users can create and manage a repository of sentences.

- **Categorization by Sections**: Sentences can be conveniently organized into sections or categories, making it easy to sort and retrieve specific content.

- **Random Sentence Retrieval**: Users have the ability to retrieve a specified number (N) of random sentences from each section during the app's lifecycle.

- **Structured Word Document**: The project provides users with the capability to generate a Word Document that organizes their selections by displaying sections and the sentences that were chosen randomly within each section.


### What this project cannot do YET:

1. **Deletion of Sentences**: At present, the user cannot delete sentences from the databank. This feature is in my roadmap for integration.

2. **Words Databank**: The user has expressed an interest in also having a databank for words. This will be integrated as well, so user has access to a databank of sentences and a databank of words.



## Distribution

If you explore this project as I distributed it to a friend, particularly someone with no programming knowledge, I tried simplifying the process to the best of my abilities.

I've bundled the project in this compressed directory: [main.zip](./dist/main.zip). Please follow these steps to use the application:

1. **Download the .zip file**: Download and save the `main.zip` file to your computer.

2. **Extract the Contents**: Unzip the file to access its contents.

3. **Locate the Main Executable**: Inside the extracted folder, you'll find a file named `main.exe`. Double-clicking this executable will start the application.

4. **Finding Your Output**: If you're wondering where the Word Document generated by the app is located, don't worry. In the same main folder, I've included an `output` directory. This is where your Word Document titled `lesson.docx` will be generated every time you select the corresponding functionality within the app's interface.
   

## Starting the Project in "development mode"

If you want to explore this repo as a "programmer" and not a "user", do the following first: 

The project's dependencies are listed in [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt).

To install the dependencies, I recommend to first start the virtual environment I was working with [myenv](./myenv).

To activate the virtual environment, navigate to the root directory of the project and run the following command:

```bash
source myenv/Scripts/activate
```
Then proceed to install dependencies (still within root directory):
```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```

This should allow you to run the project in what I refer to "development mode".

To run simply execute command (from root directory):
```bash
python main.py
```

### Important Directories

Two directories play a pivotal role when running the project in this mode: the `data` directory and the `output` directory.

- **Data Directory**: This is where users can store their data, creating a databank of information.

- **Output Directory**: The Word Document generated by the app will be written to this directory.
